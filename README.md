Task 4: REST API with Flask – User Management

This project is a beginner-friendly REST API built using 'Flask' that allows you to manage user data via standard HTTP methods. It is designed to demonstrate the fundamentals of RESTful API development.

Objective
Create a REST API that performs CRUD operations on user data using Python and Flask.

Tools Used
- 🐍 Python
- 🔥 Flask (Micro web framework)
- 📬 Postman / PowerShell / Curl (for API testing)

Features
- `GET /users` → Fetch all users  
- `GET /users/<id>` → Fetch a specific user  
- `POST /users` → Add a new user  
- `PUT /users/<id>` → Update an existing user  
- `DELETE /users/<id>` → Remove a user

Data is stored in an in-memory dictionary, making it simple and fast for demo purposes.
